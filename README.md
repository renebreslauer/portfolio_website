# View the site here: https://www.rene-breslauer.com

## This portfolio site is a work in progress built with React, Node JS, and Express JS. It is deployed and hosted with Amazon Web Services.

### Main Features:
- Contact form using Node JS and Express JS
- Styling and animations created using pure-CSS and JSX (with the exception of the Portfolio page, which imports the React-Spring library)
- All SVG animations and navbar icons are my own work, created in Adobe Illustrator

### I plan on adding the following:
- Context description to portfolio projects
- Add work to the gallery, using the Github API
- Mobile responsiveness
